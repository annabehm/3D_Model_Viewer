This is the code for the simple 3D viewer app for CoLab's Full Stack Developer (Co-op) role.
My name is Anna Behm (Student ID: 202005872). I hope you enjoy the application!


To run this application:
Go to the viewer.html file, ensure you have the Live Server Extension (if usiing Visual Studio Code), and click on the "Go Live" button on the bottom right. This will bring you to the html page where you can interact with the objects. 
Click Zoom In or Zoom Out to see the object up close or from afar.
To view the other models, you can choose from the dropdown menu. There is a slight bug when you interact with the dino or phoenix models that the other models move position, which I aim to fix asap.


This project has been very enjoyable, as you can see from the multiple addtions I have included. My next steps are to include animation for the phoenix.

Hope you enjoyed!
