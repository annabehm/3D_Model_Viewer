This is the code for the simple 3D viewer app for CoLab's Full Stack Developer (Co-op) role.
My name is Anna Behm (Student ID: 202005872). I hope you enjoy the application!


To run this application:
Go to the viewer.html file, ensure you have the Live Server Extension (if usiing Visual Studio Code), and click on the "Go Live" button on the bottom right. This will bring you to the html page where you can interact with the objects. 
Click Zoom In or Zoom Out to see the object up close or from afar.
To view the other models, you must go into the viewer.js file, make the changes to the objToRender variable, then save the file. The html page should automatically update.


To change the models, for the time being, you have to go into the viewer.js file and manually change
let objToRender = "eye";
To either 
let objToRender = "dino";
Or
let objToRender = "phoenix";
To see and interact with the two other 3D models I have in this application.


This project has been very enjoyable, as you can see from the multiple addtions I have included. My next steps are to include a drop down menu to select the models from the html page, as well as animation for the phoenix.

Hope you enjoyed!
